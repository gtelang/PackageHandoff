# Packagehandoff

This repository contains notes on and implementations of algorithms to solve  
Package handoff problems: an example of this class of problems would be a taxi-service trying to co-ordinate its fleet of cabs to transport passengers calling in from different points of the map to their destinations. Or think of [Amazon drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFj5SCdSYQg) with limited battery capcacity and varying maximum speeds working together to deliver multiple packages from warehouses to customers.

All programs have been weaved together in a literate style into
[PackageHandoff.org](https://github.com/gtelang/packagehandoff/blob/master/PackageHandoff.org) and tangled into [codeHaskell-pho](https://github.com/gtelang/packagehandoff/tree/master/codeHaskell-pho).
