# packagehandoff

This is a literate program written in a mixture of Haskell and C++ to study heuristics and algorithms for
Package handoff problems. A nice example is one where a taxi-service must co-ordinate 
its fleet of cabs to transport passengers situated at different points on the map, to their destinations.
