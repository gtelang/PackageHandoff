# Packagehandoff

This repository contains programs written in Haskell and C++ to solve Package handoff problems: think of a taxi-service co-ordinating its fleet of cabs to transport passengers calling in from different points of the map to their destinations. Or consider [Amazon drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFj5SCdSYQg) with limited battery capcacity and varying maximum speeds working together to deliver multiple packages from warehouses to customers.

More detailed introductory notes on this class of problems can be found in 
**PackageHandoff.html**.  

All programs have been weaved into
[PackageHandoff.org](https://github.com/gtelang/packagehandoff/blob/master/PackageHandoff.org) in a literate style and tangled into [codeHaskell-pho](https://github.com/gtelang/packagehandoff/tree/master/codeHaskell-pho).
