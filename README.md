# packagehandoff

This repository contains programs written in Haskell and C++ to study heuristics and algorithms for
Package handoff problems. All these programs have been weaved together in a literate style into [PackageHandoff.org](https://github.com/gtelang/packagehandoff/blob/master/PackageHandoff.org) and tangled into [codeHaskell-pho](https://github.com/gtelang/packagehandoff/tree/master/codeHaskell-pho). 

A nice instance of this family of problems is one where a taxi-service must co-ordinate its fleet of cabs to transport passengers calling in from different points of the map to their destinations. Or think of [Amazon drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFj5SCdSYQg) with limited battery capcacity and varying maximum speeds working together to deliver multiple packages from warehouses to customers. 

More detailed introductory-notes on this family of problems can be found in  [PackageHandoff.org](https://github.com/gtelang/packagehandoff/blob/master/PackageHandoff.org).
