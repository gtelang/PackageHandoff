# packagehandoff

This is a literate program written in a mixture of Haskell and C++ to study heuristics and algorithms for
Package handoff problems. A nice example of such problems iswhere a taxi-service must co-ordinate 
its fleet of cabs to transport passengers situated at different points on the map, to their destinations. Or think of [Amazon drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFj5SCdSYQg) with limited battery capcacity working together to deliver multiple packages from warehouses to customers.
